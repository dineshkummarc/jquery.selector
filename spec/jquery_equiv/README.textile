h2. jQuery Equivilence

This is the selector unit tests from jQuery, run using jquery.selector.is.

* selector.js is unchanged from jQuery (currently 1.3.2)

* index.html has the source includes changed, and a div for the results added

* support.js is custom, with just enough stuff to run the selector.js unit tests. See t() for which selectors are currently being skipped
